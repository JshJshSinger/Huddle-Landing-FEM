## My process
write html with contextual classes. Start playing around with CSS. Building out the mobile version first. Struggle with svgs, reasearch and try to implement solutions. use media queries for the desktop sizes. I adjusted many max/min widths so they'd look acceptable in a reasonable amount of screen sizes.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
